### Evaluate the Comprehensiveness of Content Coverage

This section should cover most of the aspects described in the section instructions unless there are elements that are not relevant to this particular problem or information that is simply not available at this point. I would assess the comprehensiveness of the student's writing and identify any gaps left unaddressed by the student, and assign a grade according to the point rubric accordingly.

Prompt (This prompt gave nice results in https://chat.openai.com/ and https://bard.google.com/chat .)

```
How well does the following text answer each of these questions? Why are you doing this project? What is the problem youâ€™re addressing? Who is affected? When is it a problem? Why does it matter? How does it affect the patient or system? Has a cause been identified? What will happen if this problem is not addressed?
