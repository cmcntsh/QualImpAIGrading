# Quality Improvement Manuscript AI Grading and Suggestions Resources

This is a collection of resources and prompts for evaluating and grading student papers about quality improvement projects. It is broken down by sections as defined by SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines. https://www.squire-statement.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=Page.ViewPage&PageID=471 (You can watch a video overview of the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines here. https://youtu.be/Z2wBDoks07c You can watch a video analysis of the rhetorical structure of the SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines here. https://youtu.be/40fvqNaJjl8) It is an extension of the general writing suggestions I provide in https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents. (You can also watch this video where I go over some writing suggestions. https://youtu.be/0_M34HDC9f8) The generative models listed in the table below may work. I'm ordering the table by the models that currently seem the best for this purpose. Higher up the list seems to perform better, lower down the list may not perform as well or is untested. Models get updated periodically, so performance may vary over time.

### Analyze How Paragraphs in a Section Connect With Each Other

I recommend doing this with each paper section separately.

Prompt:

```
You are an expert editor of academic writing and scholarly articles. We are going to analyze this text according to the reader expectation approach to writing described by George Gopen. We are going to focus on the logic and flow between the paragraphs of a piece of writing. Gopen states that a backward link to the previous paragraph is easiest for the reader to make if it connects to the same two locations: (1) the beginning of the previous paragraph, where its issue is stated; or (2) the end of the previous paragraph - the nearest neighbor to this new paragraph. Backward connections to the middle of the previous paragraph are harder for the reader to perceive. For each paragraph, write out the paragraph. Then answer these questions about each paragraph. Does the paragraph have a single main issue? What is it? Does the paragraph have good logic and flow internally? Does the paragraph connect well with the previous paragraph? If there is a connection between the paragraph and the previous paragraph, does the paragraph connect with the beginning, middle, or end of the previous paragraph? Are the paragraphs arranged in a logical sequence? Do the paragraphs have good flow from one to the next?
Here is the text: "<paste text here>"
```

### Analyze a Paragraph and Each Sentence in the Paragraph Using Concepts from  George Gopen's Reader Expectation Approach to Writing

```
You are an expert editor of academic writing and scholarly articles. We are going to analyze this text according to the reader expectation approach to writing described by George Gopen. Gopen states that a paragraph should describe the issue of the paragraph in the first one to three sentences of the paragraph. Gopen also states that if the paragraph explicitly states a point, it should be stated as the last sentence of the issue or the last sentence of the discussion of the paragraph. For each paragraph, write out the paragraph. Then answer these questions about each paragraph.
What is the issue of the paragraph? What is the paragraph about? Does the paragraph have a one-sentence, two-sentence, or three-sentence issue? What are the discussion points in the paragraph? Is the ordering of discussion points logical? What is the point of the paragraph? Why was the paragraph written? Is the point of the paragraph explicitly stated, or is it implied? Is the paragraph a narrative paragraph that simply relays information so a point can be made later, or is the point of the paragraph explicitly stated in the paragraph? Does the point appear at the beginning of the paragraph or at the end? If the paragraph explicitly states a point, does the point appear at the last sentence of the issue or at the last sentence of the discussion, or somewhere else in the paragraph? Does the paragraph have a coda as the last sentence of the paragraph? Can you suggest any improvements to how the paragraph is structured? Is the ordering of the paragraphs logical? Can you suggest any improvements to how the paragraphs should be ordered?
Next, analyze each sentence according to the concepts for sentence construction in the reader expectation approach described by Gopen. List each sentence and answer the following questions for the sentence.
Which words in the sentence appear in the stress position just before a period, a colon, or a semicolon? What nominalizations are used in the sentence? What are the main actions expressed as verbs in the sentence? What is the main clause of the sentence? Does the main clause end with a period, colon, or semicolon? What is the grammatical subject of the main clause? Is there a qualifying clause or phrase in the sentence? What is the subject of the qualifying clause or phrase? Does the sentence have two main clauses separated by a comma? Is the subject and the verb separated by more than four words in the sentence? Does the sentence connect backward to the sentence that precedes it? If so, what is the connection? How close to the beginning of the sentence does the link to the previous sentence appear? Can you suggest any improvements to how the sentence is structured? Can you suggest any improvements to how the sentence links to the preceding sentence to improve flow?
Here is the text: "<Paste paragraph text here between quotes.>"
```

### Evaluate Which Sentences Need Supporting Citations and References

```
Since this is academic writing, which sentences have assertions that should be supported with a citation to a reference? Please list each sentence that needs a citation and why it needs one.
```




Additional prompts for evaluating content and structure are provided in the individual sections below.

### Copyediting

You should do copyediting (checking grammar, spelling, and punctuation) on the text in each section individually. https://github.com/cmcntsh/PoWeRWritingGradStudents?tab=readme-ov-file#preliminary-check-of-grammar-and-spelling-before-sending-your-work-to-others

```
Please list each sentence of this text in a new line, and please number the lines. In addition, please review each sentence for grammar, syntax, usage, spelling, and punctuation errors and suggest specific improvements. When suggesting revisions, please list the sentence number, the original sentence, the reason a revision might be needed, and then the revised sentence. If no revision is suggested, please indicate that no revision is needed.  Here is the text: "[paste text here inside quotes]"
```

## Areas of Difficulty During Final Review Process

* All parts of the project that have been completed should be referred to in the past tense in all parts of the paper. (If you're fairly certain a part of the project will be complete by the time you're finishing your paper, it's perfectly acceptable to write about it in the past tense during earlier stages of writing.)
* All spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors need to be corrected. (Those are highlighted in red in Grammarly.)
* The review process will go much more smoothly and quickly if you edit your paper for clarity and conciseness. (Those suggestions are highlighted in blue in Grammarly.)
* Tables and Figures need to follow APA formatting standards.

* Abbreviations should be defined the first time they're used in the paper. Thereafter, only the abbreviation should be used in the paper, and not the original term.
