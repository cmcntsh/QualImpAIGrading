# Quality Improment Manuscript AI Grading and Suggestions Resources

This is a collection of resources and prompts for evaluating and grading student papers about quality improvement projects. It is broken down by sections as defined by SQUIRE 2.0 guidelines. I have tried some of these on ChatGPT https://chat.openai.com/ and Google Bard https://bard.google.com/chat . (I think ChatGPT may be a bit better right now, but both systems experience periodic updates, so that may change or vary with time.)

## 1. Title



## 2. Abstract (write last)



## 3. Problem Description

### Evaluate the Comprehensiveness of Content Coverage

This section should cover most of the aspects described in the section instructions unless there are elements that are not relevant to this particular problem or information that is simply not available at this point. I would assess the comprehensiveness of the student's writing and identify any gaps left unaddressed by the student, and assign a grade according to the point rubric accordingly.

Prompt (This prompt gave nice results in https://chat.openai.com/ and https://bard.google.com/chat .)

```
How well does the following text answer each of these questions? Why are you doing this project? What is the problem youâ€™re addressing? Who is affected? When is it a problem? Why does it matter? How does it affect the patient or system? Has a cause been identified? What will happen if this problem is not addressed?
